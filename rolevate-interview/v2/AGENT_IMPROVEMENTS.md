# Agent Improvements & Fixes

## Overview
Fixed language consistency issues and stabilized the interview agent with best practices.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Language Consistency (Issue: Language switching mid-interview)**
- **Problem**: Interview starting in Arabic then switching to English
- **Solution**: 
  - Added case-insensitive language detection (handles "arabic", "Arabic", "ar", "عربي")
  - Added explicit language enforcement in system instructions
  - Language requirement is now CRITICAL and repeated throughout instructions
  - Agent will politely redirect candidate if they switch languages

**Implementation in `orchestrator.py`:**
```python
is_arabic = any(word in interview_language.lower() for word in ["arabic", "عربي", "ar"])
language_display = "Arabic (العربية)" if is_arabic else "English"

language_instruction = (
    f"\n\n🔴 CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT 🔴\n"
    f"You MUST conduct this ENTIRE interview EXCLUSIVELY in {language_display}.\n"
    # ... enforcement rules ...
)
```

### 2. **Agent Initialization & Greeting**
- **Problem**: Agent not speaking greeting, or greeting duplicated/unstable
- **Solution**:
  - Greeting embedded in system instructions with "CRITICAL - START IMMEDIATELY" section
  - Agent naturally speaks greeting as first message based on LLM understanding
  - Removed manual `session.say()` calls that were causing conflicts
  - Greeting format: `"Hello {candidate_name}, I am Laila Al Noor from {company}. How are you today?"`

### 3. **Session Lifecycle Management**
- **Problem**: Agent exiting immediately instead of conducting interview
- **Solution**:
  - Changed from `asyncio.Event().wait()` to simple `while True: await asyncio.sleep(1)`
  - Simplified event loop for long-running jobs
  - Removed premature `session.aclose()` calls
  - Agent now stays active for entire interview duration

**Implementation in `agent.py`:**
```python
# Keep running until the job is terminated by LiveKit
while True:
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

### 4. **Error Handling & Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Resources not properly cleaned up on errors
- **Solution**:
  - Guaranteed cleanup in finally block
  - Orchestrator properly tracked for cleanup
  - Better error logging with context
  - Graceful handling of CancelledError

```python
orchestrator = None
try:
    # ... main logic ...
finally:
    if orchestrator:
        await orchestrator.cleanup()
```

## Configuration Details

### Language Detection
Supports multiple language formats:
- English: `"english"`, `"English"`, `"en"`
- Arabic: `"arabic"`, `"Arabic"`, `"ar"`, `"عربي"`

### Greeting Format
**English:**
```
"Hello {candidate_name}, I am Laila Al Noor from {company}. How are you today?"
```

**Arabic:**
```
"مرحباً {candidate_name}، أنا ليلى النور من {company}. كيف حالك اليوم؟"
```

### System Instructions Structure
1. **Role definition** - Who is the interviewer and what company
2. **Candidate info** - Name and position
3. **Interview prompt** - Cleaned of visual elements
4. **Audio-only note** - Clarifies no visual assessment
5. **Language requirement** - CRITICAL enforcement
6. **CV analysis** - Context for interviewer
7. **Start instructions** - Clear directive to begin immediately

## Best Practices Applied

✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each component has one clear purpose
✅ **No Redundancy** - Removed duplicate greeting handling
✅ **Clear Error Paths** - Consistent error handling throughout
✅ **Resource Management** - Guaranteed cleanup in finally blocks
✅ **Simple Async Patterns** - Avoided complex Event waiting
✅ **Explicit Language Control** - Multiple reinforcements in instructions
✅ **Stable Session Management** - Simple loop instead of complex event handling

## Testing & Validation

### Test Checklist
- [ ] Agent starts successfully
- [ ] Agent speaks greeting with candidate name
- [ ] Interview stays in chosen language throughout
- [ ] If candidate switches language, agent redirects to correct language
- [ ] Interview continues for full duration
- [ ] Transcript captured correctly
- [ ] Cleanup completes without errors

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Agent not speaking**
- Check system instructions are properly formatted
- Verify LLM model is responding (check logs for OpenAI calls)
- Ensure VAD model is prewarmed

**Issue: Language switching**
- Verify database has correct `interviewLanguage` value
- Check language detection regex matches the value
- Ensure instructions contain language requirement multiple times

**Issue: Agent exits early**
- Don't use `session.aclose()` in entrypoint
- Use simple `while True: await asyncio.sleep(1)` instead
- LiveKit framework will handle session cleanup

## Files Modified
- `agent.py` - Simplified entrypoint, better error handling
- `orchestrator.py` - Improved instructions, language enforcement, greeting format

## Next Steps
- Monitor interview quality and language consistency
- Collect feedback on greeting and conversation flow
- Adjust interview prompts as needed
- Track transcript accuracy
