# Reports Feature - Setup Guide

## Understanding the Two-Step Process

The reports feature works in two steps:

### Step 1: Create Report Definitions
Reports must first be **defined** in the system. A report definition includes:
- Name and description
- Type (ANALYTICS, PERFORMANCE, COMPLIANCE, etc.)
- Category (RECRUITMENT_METRICS, CANDIDATE_PIPELINE, etc.)
- Format (PDF, EXCEL, CSV, JSON, HTML, DASHBOARD)
- Configuration and parameters

### Step 2: Generate Reports
Once a report definition exists, you can **generate** it to create the actual report data:
- Click "Generate" button in the UI
- The system executes the report query
- Results are saved with execution metadata
- Generated reports can be downloaded

## Quick Start: Seed Sample Reports

We've created a script that automatically creates 15 sample report definitions for you.

### Option 1: Run with Node.js (Recommended)

```bash
# Without authentication
node scripts/seed-reports.js

# With authentication (recommended)
ACCESS_TOKEN=your_jwt_token node scripts/seed-reports.js
```

### Option 2: Run with TypeScript

```bash
# Install dependencies first if needed
npm install

# Run the TypeScript version
npx ts-node scripts/seed-reports.ts
```

### Getting Your Access Token

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console
4. Run: `localStorage.getItem('access_token')`
5. Copy the token (without quotes)

  createReport(input: $input) {
    id
    name
    status
    createdAt
  }
}
```

**Variables:**

{
  "input": {
    "name": "My Custom Report",

    "category": "RECRUITMENT_METRICS",
    "format": "PDF",
    "tags": ["custom", "analytics"],
    "isPublic": false
  }
}
```

### Via Report Service (Frontend)

```typescript
import { reportService, ReportType, ReportCategory, ReportFormat } from '@/services/report.service';

const newReport = await reportService.createReport({

## Troubleshooting

### Reports List is Empty
- Run the seed script to create sample reports
- Check if you're logged in with proper authentication
- Verify the backend is running at `http://192.168.1.210:4005`

### Cannot Generate Reports
- Ensure the report status is DRAFT or FAILED
- Check if you have proper permissions
- Look for error messages in the browser console

### Seed Script Fails
- Make sure the backend is running
- Verify the API_URL in the script matches your backend
- Use an ACCESS_TOKEN if authentication is required
- Check for error messages in the script output
