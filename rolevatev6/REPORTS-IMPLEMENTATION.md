## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. ‚úÖ Navigate to Reports page
2. ‚úÖ Verify reports load correctly
3. ‚úÖ Test search functionality
4. ‚úÖ Test all filter combinations
5. ‚úÖ Test report generation (if you have draft reports)
6. ‚úÖ Test download functionality (for completed reports)
7. ‚úÖ Test responsive design on mobile/tablet
8. ‚úÖ Test error states (disconnect network)

### Integration Testing
- Verify GraphQL queries match backend schema
- Test with various report statuses
- Test with large datasets (pagination may be needed)
- Test file downloads with different formats

## üìù Notes

### Backend Capabilities Not Yet Used
The backend has many advanced features not yet exposed in the UI:
- Report templates
- Report scheduling
- Report sharing
- Audit logs
- Custom parameters and filters
- Multiple data sources
- Report versioning

These can be added in future iterations as needed.

### Performance Considerations
- Currently fetches all reports (may need pagination for large datasets)
- Consider implementing lazy loading for very large report lists
- File downloads handled client-side (may want server-side streaming for large files)
