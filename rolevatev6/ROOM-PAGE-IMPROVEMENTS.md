const ANIMATION_TRANSITION = {
  type: "spring" as const,
  stiffness: 675,
  damping: 75,
  mass: 1,
};
```

### Features Used
- `motion.div` for animated containers
- `AnimatePresence` for enter/exit animations

- `BarVisualizer` for audio feedback
- `VideoTrack` for video rendering

```

### User Flow
