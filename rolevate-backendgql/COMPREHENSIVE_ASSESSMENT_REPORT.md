- Use CDN for static assets

**Medium-term (1000-10,000 users):**
- Separate heavy modules (CV analysis, report generation) into microservices
- Implement message queue (RabbitMQ/SQS) for async tasks
- Add database read replicas
- Implement GraphQL query complexity limits

**Long-term (10,000+ users):**
- Full microservices architecture
