## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing ‚úÖ (You Can Do Now)
- [ ] Test with structured experience data
  ```bash
  # See CV-ANALYSIS-DATA-FORMAT.md for curl command
  ```

- [ ] Test with simple string experience data
  ```bash
  # Test backward compatibility
  ```

- [ ] Test with structured education data
  ```bash
  # See CV-ANALYSIS-DATA-FORMAT.md for curl command
  ```

- [ ] Test re-analysis (no duplicates)
  ```bash
  # Run same test twice, verify only one set of records
  ```

- [ ] Check database records
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM work_experience WHERE candidateProfileId = 'your-profile-id';
  SELECT * FROM education WHERE candidateProfileId = 'your-profile-id';
  SELECT experience, education FROM candidate_profile WHERE id = 'your-profile-id';
  ```

- [ ] Verify logs show proper processing
  ```
  Look for:
  ‚úÖ Created N work experience records
  ‚úÖ Created N education records
  üìù Saved experience summary to profile
  ```

### Automated Testing (Future)
- [ ] Write Jest unit tests
- [ ] Write integration tests

## Rollback Plan (Just in Case)

### If Issues Arise:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Revert the migration (optional, data is backward compatible)
   npm run migration:revert
   
   # Revert code changes
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push
   ```

2. **Partial Rollback (Keep Features):**
   - Code changes are backward compatible
   - Old string format still works
   - No need to rollback database
   - Just fix the issue and redeploy

3. **Data Recovery:**
   - Structured records can be deleted without affecting summary text
   - Summary text in candidate_profile is preserved
   - No data loss risk

## Communication Template

### For FastAPI Developer:

```
Hi [Developer Name],

Great news! The backend is now ready to accept structured work experience 
and education data from CV analysis. This will give us much better candidate 
profiles and enable powerful features.

What you need to do:
1. Read: FASTAPI-QUICK-START.md (in the repo)
2. Update your GPT-4 prompt to extract experience/education as arrays
3. Test with a few sample CVs
4. Deploy when ready

The backend supports both the old format (strings) and new format (arrays),
so you can roll out gradually if needed.

Full documentation: CV-ANALYSIS-DATA-FORMAT.md

Let me know if you have questions!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### For Frontend Developer:

```
Hi [Developer Name],

We've upgraded our candidate data model to support structured work experience
and education. This opens up some cool UI possibilities:

Potential features:
- Timeline view of career progression
- Filter candidates by company or university
- Visual education cards with degrees and dates
- Analytics on experience levels

The data is already being collected (once FastAPI is updated). When you're
ready to build the UI, check out:
- EXPERIENCE-EDUCATION-IMPLEMENTATION.md (database schema)
- DATA-FLOW-DIAGRAMS.md (data structure)

Let's discuss priorities when you have time!

Best,
[Your Name]
```
