# 🚀 RoleVate Job Application Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. **Services Layer** (GraphQL Integration)

#### JobService (`lib/services/job_service.dart`)
Complete job management service with GraphQL queries:
- ✅ `getJobs()` - Filter by type, level, workType, location, department, featured + pagination
- ✅ `getJob(id)` - Single job with full details (company, postedBy, all fields)
- ✅ `getJobBySlug(slug)` - Get job by URL-friendly slug
- ✅ `getCompanyJobs()` - Business users' own jobs
- ✅ `saveJob(jobId, notes)` - Bookmark jobs
- ✅ `unsaveJob(jobId)` - Remove bookmark
- ✅ `isJobSaved(jobId)` - Check saved status
- ✅ `getSavedJobs()` - List all bookmarked jobs with full details

#### ApplicationService (`lib/services/application_service.dart`)
Complete application management:
- ✅ `createApplication()` - Submit with cover letter, salary expectations, notice period, resume
- ✅ `getMyApplications()` - User's applications with filters and pagination
- ✅ `getApplication(id)` - Single application with full details
- ✅ `getApplicationsByJob(jobId)` - All applications for a job (recruiters)
- ✅ `updateApplication()` - Update status, scores, notes
- ✅ `withdrawApplication()` - Cancel/remove application

---

### 2. **State Management** (GetX Controllers)

#### JobController (`lib/controllers/job_controller.dart`)
Full-featured reactive state management:

**Observable State:**
- `jobs` - List of Job objects
- `savedJobs` - List of SavedJob objects
- `myApplications` - List of Application objects
- `currentJob` - Currently viewed job
- `isLoading`, `isLoadingMore` - Loading states
- `error` - Error messages

**Filters:**
- `selectedType` - JobType filter
- `selectedLevel` - JobLevel filter  
- `selectedWorkType` - WorkType filter
- `searchLocation` - Location search
- `searchDepartment` - Department search
- `featuredOnly` - Featured jobs toggle

**Pagination:**
- `currentPage`, `pageSize`, `hasMore`
- Load more functionality

**Methods:**
- ✅ `fetchJobs({loadMore})` - Fetch with filters & pagination
- ✅ `fetchJob(id)` / `fetchJobBySlug(slug)` - Single job
- ✅ `saveJob()` / `unsaveJob()` / `toggleSaveJob()` - Bookmark management
- ✅ `isJobSaved(jobId)` - Check if bookmarked
- ✅ `fetchSavedJobs()` - Get all bookmarks
- ✅ `fetchMyApplications()` - Get user applications
- ✅ `hasApplied(jobId)` - Check if already applied
- ✅ `applyFilters()` / `clearFilters()` - Filter management
- ✅ `hasActiveFilters` / `activeFilterCount` - Filter state

---

### 3. **UI Widgets** (Reusable Components)

#### JobCard (`lib/widgets/job_card.dart`)
Production-ready job card widget:
- ✅ Company logo or placeholder
- ✅ Company name and location
- ✅ Job title (2 line max)
- ✅ Department display
- ✅ Type/Level/WorkType chips with icons
- ✅ Salary display with dollar icon
- ✅ Deadline with countdown/expired indicator
- ✅ Featured badge for promoted jobs
- ✅ Reactive bookmark button (saves/unsaves)
- ✅ Tap to navigate to job details
- ✅ Uses Job model (not Map)

#### ApplicationStatusBadge (`lib/widgets/application_status_badge.dart`)
Status indicator with colors and icons:
- ✅ **Pending** - Orange/clock icon
- ✅ **Reviewed** - Blue/eye icon
- ✅ **Shortlisted** - Cyan/star icon
- ✅ **Interviewed** - Cyan/video icon
- ✅ **Offered** - Green/thumbs up
- ✅ **Hired** - Green/checkmark seal
- ✅ **Analyzed** - Cyan/chart icon
- ✅ **Rejected** - Red/X icon
- ✅ **Withdrawn** - Grey/back arrow
- ✅ Compact mode for tight spaces
- ✅ Semantic colors matching status

---

### 4. **Bug Fixes**

✅ Fixed `errorMessage` → `error` in JobController
✅ Removed old Map-based JobCard from home_screen.dart
✅ Created proper JobCard widget with Job model
✅ Added job_card.dart import to home_screen
✅ Updated theme imports (config → core/theme)
✅ Fixed typography (titleMedium → headlineMedium)
✅ Fixed colors (warning50/warning600 → warning with opacity)
✅ Fixed colors (neutralLight → iosSystemGrey6)
✅ Fixed JobStatus enum (ACTIVE → active)
✅ Fixed Application model (jobId → job.id)
✅ Fixed SavedJob model (removed null check on non-nullable jobId)
