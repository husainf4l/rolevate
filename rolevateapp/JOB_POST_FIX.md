# Job Posting Failure - Fixed! 🔧

## What I Did

I've added comprehensive diagnostics and improved error handling for job posting failures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Diagnostic Utility (`lib/utils/connection_test.dart`)
This new utility tests:
- ✅ Backend connectivity
- ✅ Authentication status  
- ✅ User type (must be BUSINESS)
- ✅ Company association (required for posting jobs)
- ✅ GraphQL schema validation

### 2. Enhanced Post Job Screen (`lib/screens/business/post_job_screen.dart`)
Added:
- 🔍 **Diagnostic button** (info icon) in navigation bar
- 📊 **Detailed error dialogs** with option to run diagnostics
- 🎯 **Better error messages** showing exactly what went wrong

### 3. Documentation (`TROUBLESHOOTING_JOB_POST.md`)
Complete troubleshooting guide covering:
- Common issues and solutions
- Debug checklist
- Quick fixes
- Testing procedures

## How to Use

### Option 1: Run Diagnostics (Recommended)
1. Open the Post Job screen
2. Tap the **ℹ️ info icon** in the top-right corner
3. Review the diagnostic results
4. Fix any issues highlighted

### Option 2: Check Console Logs
When you try to post a job, the console will show:
```
🚀 _postJob called
✅ Form validation passed
📝 Creating job with title: [Job Title]
📡 Sending GraphQL mutation with variables: {...}
```

If it fails, you'll see:
```
❌ GraphQL exception: [error details]
📋 Detailed error: [full error breakdown]
```

## Common Issues and Quick Fixes

### Issue 1: "Not authenticated - no token found"
**Cause:** You're not logged in
**Fix:** Log in as a BUSINESS user first

### Issue 2: "User type is CANDIDATE, must be BUSINESS to post jobs"
**Cause:** Logged in with wrong account type
**Fix:** Log out and log in with a BUSINESS account

### Issue 3: "User has no company association"
**Cause:** Business user hasn't completed company profile
**Fix:** Complete company setup in settings

### Issue 4: "Connection failed" or "Network error"
**Cause:** Backend not accessible
**Fix:** 
- Check backend is running
- Verify URL in `lib/main.dart` (line 42)
- Current URL: `https://rolevate.com/api/graphql`
- For local dev: `http://10.0.2.2:4005/graphql` (Android) or `http://localhost:4005/graphql` (iOS)

## Backend URL Configuration

The app currently points to:
```dart
GraphQLService.initialize('https://rolevate.com/api/graphql');
```

**For local development**, change to:
```dart
// Android Emulator
GraphQLService.initialize('http://10.0.2.2:4005/graphql');

// iOS Simulator  
GraphQLService.initialize('http://localhost:4005/graphql');

// Physical device (use your computer's IP)
GraphQLService.initialize('http://YOUR_IP:4005/graphql');
```

## Testing Without Backend

If you need to test the UI without a backend:

1. Open `lib/services/job_service.dart`
2. Find the `createJob` method (line 771)
3. Uncomment the "TEMPORARY: Mock implementation" section (lines 790-856)
4. Comment out the "ORIGINAL CODE" section (lines 857-932)

This will use mock data and simulate successful job creation.

## What the Diagnostic Button Shows

When you tap the info icon, you'll see a dialog with:
- ✅ Connection status
- ✅ Authentication status
- ✅ Business user verification
- ✅ Company association check
- ⚠️ List of any errors found

Example output:
```
✅ All Checks Passed
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Connection
✓ Authentication
✓ Business User
✓ Has Company
```

Or if there are issues:
```
⚠️ Issues Found
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Connection
✗ Authentication
✗ Business User
✗ Has Company

Errors:
• Not authenticated - no token found
• User type is null, must be BUSINESS to post jobs
• User has no company association
```

## Next Steps

1. **Try posting a job** - the error message will now be much more helpful
2. **Tap the diagnostic button** if posting fails
3. **Follow the suggested fixes** based on the diagnostic results
4. **Check the console** for detailed debug logs

## Files Modified

- ✅ `lib/screens/business/post_job_screen.dart` - Enhanced error handling & diagnostics
- ✅ `lib/utils/connection_test.dart` - New diagnostic utility
- ✅ `TROUBLESHOOTING_JOB_POST.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide
- ✅ `JOB_POST_FIX.md` - This summary

## Technical Details

The diagnostic tool checks:

1. **Basic connectivity** - Can the app reach the GraphQL endpoint?
2. **Token presence** - Is there a stored authentication token?
3. **User type** - Is the user type "BUSINESS"?
4. **Company association** - Does the user have a linked company?

It does this by:
- Running a basic `__typename` query to test connection
- Checking GetStorage for token, userType, and userId
- Running a `me` query to fetch user details and company info

All results are displayed in an easy-to-read dialog with actionable suggestions.

**You're all set!** Try posting a job now, and if it fails, the app will guide you through fixing it. 🚀
