## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens with 7-day expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Strong password requirements
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt, 12 salt rounds)

### Security Headers
- Helmet.js for security headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options protection

### Rate Limiting
- Global rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Protection against brute force attacks
- Configurable rate limits per endpoint

### Data Protection
- Data encryption utilities for sensitive information
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection via Prisma ORM
- XSS protection through input validation

### Security Monitoring
- Comprehensive security event logging
- Failed authentication tracking
- Suspicious activity detection
- Security metrics and alerting

### Data Privacy
- IP address anonymization in logs
- User agent hashing for privacy
- Minimal data retention policies
- GDPR-compliant data handling

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Strong JWT secret (256-bit minimum)
JWT_SECRET=your-strong-secret-key

# Encryption key for sensitive data
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key

# CORS allowed origins
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com

# Rate limiting configuration
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
```

### Security Logs
All security events are logged to the `security_logs` table:
- Authentication failures and successes
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious activities
- Administrative actions

### Incident Response

#### Security Event Types
- `AUTH_FAILURE`: Failed authentication attempts
- `AUTH_SUCCESS`: Successful authentications
- `UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS`: Access to protected resources without proper authorization
- `DATA_BREACH_ATTEMPT`: Suspected data breach attempts
- `SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY`: Anomalous behavior patterns

#### Severity Levels
- `LOW`: Normal security events (successful logins)
- `MEDIUM`: Potential security issues (failed logins)
- `HIGH`: Suspicious activities requiring attention
- `CRITICAL`: Immediate security threats requiring urgent response

#### Response Procedures
1. **Critical Events**: Immediate alert to security team
2. **High Severity**: Investigation within 1 hour
3. **Medium Severity**: Review within 24 hours
4. **Low Severity**: Routine monitoring

## Compliance Monitoring

### Security Metrics
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious activity counts
- Data access patterns
- System availability metrics

### Regular Assessments
- Monthly security reviews
- Quarterly vulnerability assessments
- Annual security audits
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## Reporting Security Issues

To report a security vulnerability:
1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to your security team
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for investigation and fix

## Security Updates
