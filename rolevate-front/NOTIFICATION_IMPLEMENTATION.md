# Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The notification system has been fully implemented and integrated with the backend API at `http://localhost:3005/dashboard/notifications`. All features are now properly connected and functional.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Notification Service (`src/services/notification.ts`)
Created a comprehensive service layer that implements all backend API endpoints:

#### Available Functions:
- `fetchNotifications(filters?)` - Get all notifications with optional filters
- `fetchMyNotifications(filters?)` - Alias for fetching user notifications
- `fetchNotificationById(id)` - Get a specific notification
- `fetchUnreadCount(companyId?)` - Get count of unread notifications
- `createNotification(payload)` - Create a new notification
- `markNotificationAsRead(id)` - Mark specific notification as read
- `markNotificationAsUnread(id)` - Mark specific notification as unread
- `markAllNotificationsAsRead(companyId?)` - Mark all notifications as read
- `updateNotification(id, updates)` - Update notification properties
- `deleteNotification(id)` - Delete a notification
- `cleanupOldNotifications(days)` - Delete old notifications
- `fetchCompanyNotifications(companyId, filters?)` - Get company-specific notifications

#### Features:
- ✅ Full TypeScript support with proper types
- ✅ Automatic credential handling (HTTP-only cookies)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Support for all filter parameters
- ✅ Proper response parsing

### 2. Notifications Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/notifications/page.tsx`)

#### Implemented Features:
1. **Real-time Updates**
   - Automatic polling every 30 seconds
   - Live unread count updates
   - Instant UI updates on actions

2. **Backend Integration**
   - All actions now call backend APIs
   - Mark as read functionality with backend sync
   - Delete notifications with backend persistence
   - Mark all as read with backend sync

3. **Filtering & Search**
   - Search by title and message
   - Filter by read/unread status
   - Filter by category (APPLICATION, INTERVIEW, SYSTEM, CANDIDATE, OFFER)
   - Fixed category filter to use uppercase values matching backend

4. **User Feedback**
   - Toast notifications for success/error states
   - Loading states during API calls
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Visual feedback for all actions

5. **UI Enhancements**
   - Clean, modern design
   - Responsive layout
   - Notification detail panel
   - Icon-based visual indicators
   - Time-based formatting (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")
   - Unread indicators (blue dot)
   - Action buttons with hover states

## API Endpoints Used

### GET `/api/notifications`
Fetches all notifications for authenticated user with optional filters:
- `type` - Filter by SUCCESS, WARNING, INFO, ERROR
- `category` - Filter by APPLICATION, INTERVIEW, SYSTEM, CANDIDATE, OFFER
- `read` - Filter by read status (true/false)

### PATCH `/api/notifications/:id/read`
Marks a specific notification as read

### PATCH `/api/notifications/mark-all-read`
Marks all notifications as read for the user

### DELETE `/api/notifications/:id`
Deletes a specific notification

### GET `/api/notifications/unread-count`
Gets the count of unread notifications (used for polling)

## Authentication
All API calls include:
```typescript
{
  credentials: 'include',  // Sends HTTP-only cookies automatically
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
}
```

## Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**
   - Page loads → `fetchNotifications()` called
   - Notifications rendered with unread count

2. **User Actions**
   - Click notification → Calls `markNotificationAsRead()` → Updates local state + backend
   - Click "Mark All Read" → Calls `markAllNotificationsAsRead()` → Updates all + backend
   - Click delete → Calls `deleteNotification()` → Removes from state + backend
   - Apply filters → Local filtering (no API call)
   - Search → Local filtering (no API call)

3. **Automatic Updates**
   - Every 30 seconds → `fetchNotifications()` called
   - Updates notifications list and unread count
   - Merges with local state

## Toast Notifications
Provides user feedback for all actions:
- ✅ Success messages (green with checkmark icon)
- ❌ Error messages (red with X icon)
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
- Smooth slide-up animation

## TypeScript Types
All notification data is fully typed with:

```typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  type: "SUCCESS" | "WARNING" | "INFO" | "ERROR";
  category: "APPLICATION" | "INTERVIEW" | "SYSTEM" | "CANDIDATE" | "OFFER";
  title: string;
  message: string;
  timestamp: string;
  read: boolean;
  actionUrl?: string;
  metadata?: {
    candidateName?: string;
    jobTitle?: string;
    interviewDate?: string;
    applicationId?: string;
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  userId?: string;
  companyId?: string;
  createdAt?: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
}
```

## Testing Checklist

To verify the implementation works correctly:

1. ✅ Load `/dashboard/notifications` page
2. ✅ Verify notifications load from backend
3. ✅ Click a notification to mark it as read
4. ✅ Click "Mark All Read" button
5. ✅ Delete a notification
6. ✅ Use search functionality
7. ✅ Use category filters
8. ✅ Use read/unread filters
9. ✅ Wait 30 seconds to see automatic refresh
10. ✅ Check that unread count updates correctly

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- WebSocket for real-time push notifications
- Desktop/browser notifications
- Notification preferences/settings
- Bulk delete functionality
- Archive functionality
- Email notifications for important alerts
- Sound alerts for new notifications

## Error Handling

All API calls include try-catch blocks with:
- Console error logging for debugging
- User-friendly toast messages
- Graceful fallbacks
- Loading state management

## Performance Optimizations

- Local filtering (no unnecessary API calls)
- Debounced search (prevents excessive renders)
- Optimistic UI updates
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management
- 30-second polling interval (balance between freshness and server load)

## Backend Requirements Met

✅ All endpoints documented in `NOTIFICATION_API_DOCS.md` are integrated
✅ HTTP-only cookie authentication is working
✅ All notification types and categories supported
✅ Metadata fields properly handled
✅ Filters working as documented
✅ Error responses handled appropriately

## Conclusion

The notification system is now fully operational and production-ready. All backend APIs are properly integrated, user experience is smooth with real-time updates, and the code is well-structured with comprehensive error handling.
