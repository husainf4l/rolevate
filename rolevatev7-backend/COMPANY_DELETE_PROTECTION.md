# Company Delete Protection - Implementation Summary

## Issue
The `removeCompany` mutation in the company resolver had NO authentication or authorization guards, allowing ANY user (including unauthenticated) to delete any company from the system.

## Solution Implemented

### File: `src/company/company.resolver.ts`

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
@Mutation(() => Boolean)
async removeCompany(@Args('id', { type: () => ID }) id: string): Promise<boolean> {
  return this.companyService.remove(id);
}
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
@Mutation(() => Boolean)
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(UserType.ADMIN, UserType.SYSTEM)
async removeCompany(@Args('id', { type: () => ID }) id: string): Promise<boolean> {
  return this.companyService.remove(id);
}
```

### Changes Made

1. **Added Imports:**
   ```typescript
   import { RolesGuard } from '../auth/roles.guard';
   import { Roles } from '../auth/roles.decorator';
   import { UserType } from '../user/user.entity';
   ```

2. **Added Guards:**
   - `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` - Requires authentication and role checking
   - `@Roles(UserType.ADMIN, UserType.SYSTEM)` - Only ADMIN or SYSTEM users can delete

## How It Works

### Guard Chain
1. **JwtAuthGuard** - Validates JWT token
2. **RolesGuard** - Checks if user's role is ADMIN or SYSTEM
3. If both pass ‚Üí Mutation executes
4. If either fails ‚Üí 403 Forbidden error returned

## Access Control

### Who Can Delete Companies

| User Type | Can Delete | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| ADMIN | ‚úÖ Yes | Full access |
| SYSTEM | ‚úÖ Yes | Full access |
| BUSINESS | ‚ùå No | Regular business user |
| CANDIDATE | ‚ùå No | Job candidate |
| Anonymous | ‚ùå No | Not authenticated |

## Testing

### Test Case 1: ADMIN User CAN Delete
```graphql
mutation {
  removeCompany(id: "company-id") # ‚úÖ Success
}
```

**Expected:** Returns `true` (deletion successful)

### Test Case 2: CANDIDATE User CANNOT Delete
```graphql
mutation {
  removeCompany(id: "company-id") # ‚ùå Blocked
}
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Access denied. Required roles: ADMIN, SYSTEM. User role: CANDIDATE",
    "extensions": { "code": "FORBIDDEN" }
  }]
}
```

### Test Case 3: Unauthenticated User CANNOT Delete
```graphql
mutation {
  removeCompany(id: "company-id") # ‚ùå Blocked
}
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "User not authenticated",
    "extensions": { "code": "FORBIDDEN" }
  }]
}
```

## Security Impact

### Vulnerabilities Fixed
1. ‚úÖ Unauthenticated users cannot delete companies
2. ‚úÖ BUSINESS users cannot delete companies
3. ‚úÖ CANDIDATE users cannot delete companies
4. ‚úÖ Only ADMIN/SYSTEM can delete

### Risk Level
- **Before:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Anyone could delete any company
- **After:** üü¢ SECURE - Only authorized users can delete

## Related Endpoints

The following company endpoints also need security review:
- ‚úÖ `removeCompany` - PROTECTED (this fix)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `updateCompany` - Currently unprotected - needs fix
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `companies` query - Currently unprotected - needs review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `company(id)` query - Currently unprotected - needs review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `companiesByUser` - Currently unprotected - needs authorization

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/company/company.resolver.ts` | Added imports and guards to `removeCompany` |

## Compilation Status

‚úÖ No TypeScript compilation errors
‚úÖ All imports valid
‚úÖ Guards properly registered
‚úÖ Ready for deployment
