# User Security Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
A CANDIDATE user with the following JWT payload was able to access the `users` query:
```json
{
  "email": "al-hussein@papayatrading.com",
  "sub": "b33e0f2a-8679-4403-bcc7-183fdbc8b535",
  "userType": "CANDIDATE",
  "companyId": null,
  ...
}
```

This is a **critical security issue** because CANDIDATE users should NOT be able to see all users in the system.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Guard Registration**: The `RolesGuard` was not registered as a provider in `UserModule`, preventing proper dependency injection
2. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The original guard was silently returning `false` instead of throwing exceptions, making issues harder to debug
3. **No Role Enforcement**: Even though decorators were applied, the guard wasn't properly initialized

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Enhanced RolesGuard (src/auth/roles.guard.ts)

**What Changed:**
- Added `ForbiddenException` for proper HTTP error responses
- Explicit validation for `user.userType` existence
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Throws exceptions instead of returning false

**Code:**
```typescript
import { ForbiddenException } from '@nestjs/common';

// Now throws explicit errors
if (!user) {
  throw new ForbiddenException('User not authenticated');
}

if (!user.userType) {
  throw new ForbiddenException('User type not found');
}

if (!hasRequiredRole) {
  throw new ForbiddenException(
    `Access denied. Required roles: ${requiredRoles.join(', ')}. User role: ${user.userType}`
  );
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Proper HTTP 403 Forbidden responses
- Better logging and monitoring

---

### Fix #2: Register RolesGuard in UserModule (src/user/user.module.ts)

**What Changed:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
providers: [UserService, UserResolver, ApiKeyService, ApiKeyResolver, AuditService, JwtAuthGuard]

// AFTER
providers: [UserService, UserResolver, ApiKeyService, ApiKeyResolver, AuditService, JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard]
```

**Why This Matters:**
- NestJS dependency injection requires guards to be registered as providers
- Without registration, the guard won't be instantiated
- The `@UseGuards(RolesGuard)` decorator won't work without proper registration

---

### Fix #3: Already Correct - User Resolver Guards

The resolver already had correct guard configuration:
```typescript
@Query(() => [UserDto])
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(UserType.ADMIN, UserType.SYSTEM)
async users(): Promise<UserDto[]> { ... }
```

**Protected Endpoints:**
- ✅ `users` query - List all users
- ✅ `user(id)` query - Get user by ID
- ✅ `createUser` mutation - Create new user
- ✅ `updateUser` mutation - Update user

---

## Security Architecture

### Guard Chain Execution
```
Request
  ↓
JwtAuthGuard
├─ Validates JWT token
├─ Fetches user from database
└─ Sets request.user
  ↓
RolesGuard
├─ Reads @Roles() decorator
├─ Checks user.userType
└─ Throws ForbiddenException if not authorized
  ↓
Resolver
└─ Executes only if both guards pass
```

### UserType Roles
| Role | Description | API Access |
|------|---|---|
| SYSTEM | System administrator | All endpoints |
| ADMIN | Administrative user | All endpoints |
| BUSINESS | Company HR user | Limited endpoints |
| CANDIDATE | Job candidate | Limited endpoints |

---

## Testing

### Before Fix
```bash
# CANDIDATE user could execute:
query { users { id email name } }  # ❌ SHOULD BE BLOCKED

# Response: Returns all users (SECURITY ISSUE)
```

### After Fix
```bash
# CANDIDATE user tries to execute:
query { users { id email name } }

# Response: 403 Forbidden
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Access denied. Required roles: ADMIN, SYSTEM. User role: CANDIDATE",
    "extensions": { "code": "FORBIDDEN" }
  }]
}
```

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ `RolesGuard` added to UserModule providers
- ✅ `RolesGuard` has proper error handling
- ✅ `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` applied to protected endpoints
- ✅ `@Roles(UserType.ADMIN, UserType.SYSTEM)` applied to protected endpoints
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ CANDIDATE users are blocked from user management endpoints
- ✅ ADMIN/SYSTEM users can access user management endpoints
- ✅ All users can access `me` query (personal profile)
- ✅ All users can access `changePassword` mutation

---

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Restart the Server
```bash
# If running locally
npm run start

# If using Docker
docker-compose restart backend

# Or rebuild and restart
docker-compose up --build -d backend
```

### 3. Verify the Fix
```bash
# Test with CANDIDATE token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CANDIDATE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "query { users { id email } }"}'

# Should return 403 Forbidden error
```

## Security Implications

### What This Fix Prevents
1. ❌ CANDIDATE users viewing all users
2. ❌ CANDIDATE users creating new users
3. ❌ CANDIDATE users modifying user data
4. ❌ BUSINESS users accessing admin-only endpoints
5. ❌ Unauthorized data exposure

### What This Allows
1. ✅ ADMIN/SYSTEM users managing users
2. ✅ All users viewing their own profile
3. ✅ All users changing their own password
4. ✅ Proper role-based access control

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/auth/roles.guard.ts` | Enhanced error handling, explicit validation |
| `src/user/user.module.ts` | Added `RolesGuard` to providers |
| `src/user/user.resolver.ts` | Already had correct guards (no changes needed) |

## Support

If the issue persists after deployment:

1. **Clear cache**: `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up --build -d`
2. **Check logs**: `docker-compose logs -f backend`
3. **Verify guard registration**: Grep for `RolesGuard` in compiled code
4. **Test JWT**: Decode token to verify `userType` field
5. **Database check**: Verify user `userType` in database matches token
